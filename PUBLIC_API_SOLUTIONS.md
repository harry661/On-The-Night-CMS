# 🌐 Making Your API Public for Figma Make

## 🚨 **The Problem**
Figma Make can't access `localhost:8000` APIs because your laptop isn't publicly accessible from the internet.

## 💡 **Solutions (Pick One)**

### **Option 1: ngrok (Easiest)**
Free tunnel that makes your localhost publicly accessible:

1. **Sign up** at https://ngrok.com (free)
2. **Download** the macOS app from their website
3. **Run tunnel**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
4. **Get public URL** like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
5. **Update Figma Make** with the ngrok URL

### **Option 2: Laravel Herd (If Using)**
If you're on Herd, it has built-in tunneling:
1. **Open Herd app**
2. **Go to Sites → Your Site**
3. **Click "Share via tunnel"**
4. **Get public URL**

### **Option 3: LocalTunnel (No Signup)**
```bash
npx localtunnel --port 8000
```

### **Option 4: Deploy to Cloud**
Deploy your Laravel app to:
- **Railway** (free tier)
- **Heroku** (free tier)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** (free credits)

### **Option 5: Use Test Domain**
Set up a free subdomain:
- **ngrok** (easiest)
- **PageKite**
- **Serveo**

# Test authentication
curl -X POST https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"mobile@onthenight.app","password":"password"}'
```
